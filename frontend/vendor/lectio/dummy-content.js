    explanation: {
        body: 'This question forced mathematicians to invent an entirely new branch of mathematics. Algebra can find averages — how fast something moved over ten seconds, how much water flowed in an hour. But it breaks down at the boundary: the speed at one instant, the exact area under a curve. Calculus was invented to cross that boundary. It introduced two core tools: derivatives (which measure instantaneous rates of change) and integrals (which measure total accumulation). These tools turn out to be opposites of each other — a discovery called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that connects the two halves into one unified framework.',

        body: "Newton's Second Law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Written as F = ma, this single equation connects three fundamental quantities: force (measured in Newtons), mass (in kilograms), and acceleration (in metres per second squared). If you double the force on an object, its acceleration doubles. If you double the mass, its acceleration halves. This is why the tennis ball accelerates so much more than the bowling ball — same force, far less mass. The law also works in reverse: if you know the acceleration and mass, you can calculate exactly how much force is being applied.",
