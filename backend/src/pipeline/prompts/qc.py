Expected pacing: {guidance['pacing']}
Avoid: {', '.join(guidance['avoid'])}

Evaluate each of these criteria:

HOOK: Does it create genuine felt need? Does the student want to know
  what comes next? Or is it just announcing the topic?

EXPLANATION: Is the core concept actually explained, not just
  described? Does each sentence build on the last?

PRACTICE: Are the problems genuinely graduated in difficulty?
  Does the warm problem test recall? Does the cold problem require
  transfer?

PITFALL (if present): Is the misconception specific and real?
  Or is it trivially obvious?

WORKED EXAMPLE (if present): Does each step state why, not just
  what? Could a student who is stuck follow this?

Output a JSON object with:
  passed: bool
  issues: list of objects, each with:
    block: which field failed (e.g. "hook", "explanation")
    severity: "blocking" (must fix) or "warning" (should fix)
    message: one sentence describing the problem
  warnings: list of strings (minor style notes)

If passed is true, issues must be empty.
Output only valid JSON. No preamble, no markdown fences."""
