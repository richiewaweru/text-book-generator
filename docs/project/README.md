## Relationship to `agents/`

- `agents/` has the universal standards, workflows, and project config in `agents/project.md`.
- This directory has project-specific docs that go deeper: architecture details, setup instructions, CI workflow.
- `agents/project.md` is the quick reference. These docs are the detailed reference.

## Archive Note

`docs/v0.1.0/` is kept as a historical snapshot. Current implementation details live here under `docs/project/`.
